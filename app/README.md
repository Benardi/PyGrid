### Grid apps

Here are a few implementations of Flask apps that are able to communicate to a GridClient. These apps can be seen as the "backend" or the "server" of a GridClient.

**WARNING**: In the near future we should have a single app based on the websocket app that implements all the logic that is currently present in these 3 separate apps (https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid/issues/281).
